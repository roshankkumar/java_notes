1) in web.xml servlet mapping is done. We use FrontControllerArchitecture

Disptachinfolet we use is
com.metricstream.systemi.client.servlet.Dispatcher

2) URL mapping is done in web.xml 

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>systemi</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/systemi/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>

So all the request with the pattern  /systemi/* . Where * is can be any is redirected to dispatch servlet mapped in step 1.

3) Disptcher return ControllerBase instance, we use singleton design pattern where a single instance of class will be jvm. So when app starts this single instance [ Thread Safe Singleton ]serves all request.

public static synchronized ControllerBase create() {
		if (controller_base == null)
			controller_base = new Controller();
		return controller_base;

	} 

Above method is synchronized to handle multithread 
situation. only one thread can execute this method at a time. 

4) Any requests comes to server, Dispatch which is sub class of FrontController doGet method invoked which inturn calls doRequest.

Note: Main servlet entry point to dispatch between page helpers
 * producing real pages for a user agent requests.

5) doRequest method extracts helpername from req object.
for eg:/systemi/Userlogin, Userlogin is helper name.
